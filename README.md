# AoC22
## Advent of Code 2022

 My attempts at solving the Advent of Code challenges for 2022.
 I intend to write my code in a different language each day as 
 an additional challenge.

## Journal
 - Day 1  - Java   - like riding a bike 
 - Day 2  - Kotlin - like riding a bike but slightly different
 - Day 3  - C++    - I forgot how fast C++ is
 - Day 4  - Ruby   - If python sucked
 - Day 5  - Dart   - Like if typescript but more java
 - Day 6  - Racket - Like putting on an old sweater you expect to be cozy, but is just really scratchy
 - Day 7  - Go
